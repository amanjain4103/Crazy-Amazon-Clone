# Crazy-Amazon-Clone

### Why This?
I developed this webapp with the sole motive of implementing biggest features of the e-commerce superpower "Amazon" so that when I want to do something similar I can do it more efficiently. It's just two days I finished my previous project, I'm shopping for new headphones and suddenly while surfing on amazon I was spellbound with its features and something usual happened, I started to implement its big features one after another.

### What does this bring to the table?
Categorized products from API, view them, add them, signup/signin, checkout, payment, your orders, and what not. I started with hard coded products then moved to API and also categorized them, But the view is just the begenning then I added a product view section and implemented a image zoom on hover feature (responsive too). Huhh! later I moved to signup/signin so that only signed in people can buy, and adding google auth is fun too. Then Animated bucket may blow your mind, if not then go ahead and make payment, although its a test stripe account but everything is super natural. And still you are normal then test responsiveness that will definately blow your mind.
